# Project Xavier:  Brain-Computer Interface(BCI) for Wheelchair Control

Our goal for this project is to accomplish:

● EEG Acquisition: A custom 3D-Printed OpenBCI Mark IV headset paired with the 
OpenBCI Cyton board, optimized for electrode placement over the motor cortex. 

● Signal Processing & Machine Learning: Algorithms to filter noise, extract motor imagery 
features, and classify brain signals into discrete commands with minimal latency. 

● Wireless Communication: A reliable data link between the BCI processing unit and 
wheelchair’s onboard controller. 

● Wheelchair Platform: A dual-motor drive base with integrated safety features such as 
emergency stop, low speed control, and fault-tolerant operation. 

● Universal Mount: A modular mount system to ensure compatibility with non-powered 
wheelchair designs.
